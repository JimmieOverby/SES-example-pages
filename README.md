SES-example-pages
=================

The example pages that are available with the Sitecore E-Commerce Services (SES) module on the Sitecore Developer Network (SDN) do not include the source code.   The source code is now available in a package with the sample pages on the Sitecore Marketplace.     The example pages are part demo and part reference to help you learn how to use the core SES services. The example pages are not intended for use in production environments.      The example pages were developed a few years ago and some parts of the solution do not follow current Sitecore best practices.
